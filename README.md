## What is "Bad Apple!!"?

> "Bad Apple!!" is a Japanese dance pop song originally featured in one of the arcade games from the Touhou series. Since its rise to popularity on Nico Nico Douga (NND) in 2009, the song has inspired an extensive list of remixes, dances and musical tributes primarily on the Japanese web. In October 2010, the original upload became the first NND video to reach 10 million views. 

> “Bad Apple!!” was originally included in the soundtrack of Level Stage 3 in the 4th Touhou Project game Lotus Land Story, created by series designer [ZUN](http://www16.big.or.jp/~zun/) and released in July 1998.

> On May 20th, 2007, Masayoshi Minoshima, the founder of well-known, Touhou-affiliated doujin club [Alstroemeria Records](http://alst.net/) released a remix of “Bad Apple!!” featuring the voice of Japanese pop singer Nomico in an album called Lovelight.
